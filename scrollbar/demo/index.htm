 <p>The tableau was a visible reminder of how circumstances had conspired over the past few days to bring all the reigning families of the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/d/democratic_party/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Democratic Party">Democratic Party</a> together around the drama of Mr. Clinton’s trip to North Korea. </p><p>There on the tarmac in California were the two dominant Democrats of the 1990s, having helped to ease an international crisis on behalf of an administration in which <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/hillary_rodham_clinton/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Hillary Rodham Clinton.">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a> serves as secretary of state to the man, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Barack Obama.">President Obama</a>, who defeated Mrs. Clinton last year in a bitter race for the Democratic presidential nomination.</p><p>Within those three families, there have been many feuds and bruised egos over the years. Most of them now appear to have been set aside. While Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore did not linger together in public on Wednesday morning, and have had relatively little contact over the past eight years, according to an associate of the two men, they have both built post-White House roles and reputations that seem to have left them at peace with their shared pasts. </p><p>For just a moment, even with their extra heft and greyer hair, it was easy to recall the most famous time Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore appeared together, campaigning across the country in 1992 as the Democratic candidate for president and vice president. It was a ticket that seemed to challenge political wisdom — two men, both relatively young, both from the South, both moderates — and seemed to augur a new chapter in American politics.</p><p>On the campaign trail, and later in the White House, the two men and their spouses were friends: Sharing a bus and jokes and warm embraces, Mr. Gore introducing Mr. Clinton at every stop of the way, feeding off each other’s riffs and energies. Perhaps inevitably, by the end of Mr. Clinton’s second term that relationship had turned into an estrangement, a bitter endnote to their eight years together in Washington.</p><p>Mr. Gore remained loyal to Mr. Clinton during the second term, but made clear to associates his deep disapproval of Mr. Clinton’s affair with an intern. After Mr. Gore ran for president in 2000 and lost the electoral college vote to <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/george_w_bush/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about George W. Bush.">George W. Bush</a> on a ruling by the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/supreme_court/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about the U.S. Supreme Court.">Supreme Court</a>, he and Mr. Clinton had an intense Oval Office encounter. Mr. Gore blamed Mr. Clinton for his loss, and Mr. Clinton angrily attacked Mr. Gore for distancing himself, not even permitting him to campaign in states like Arkansas. It was described by associates as their first significant conversation in 18 months.</p><p>Over the past eight years, both men have gone down different roads in trying to rebuild their reputations: Mr. Gore as a champion in the fight against <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="Recent and archival news about global warming.">global warming</a> and an outsize figure in the Democratic Party, Mr. Clinton the global ambassador, leading the world fight against AIDS and poverty. Their contact in recent years has been irregular, but when Mr. Gore called Mr. Clinton 10 days ago to ask for his help, Mr. Clinton quickly agreed. </p><p>And while they might have crossed paths from time to time, there has clearly been nothing like the moment when Mr. Gore — spotting Mr. Clinton at the top of the steps coming off the aircraft — walked forward, clapping his hands loudly, leading the audience in applause. </p><p>They shook hands first, and than hugged for a full five seconds, with Mr. Clinton patting his hand along Mr. Gore’s back and lingering before moving on to greet the waiting family members.</p><nyt_update_bottom>
